# Starbucks Logo Preference Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis of consumer preferences between the old (pre-2011) and new (2011 to present) Starbucks logos. As an aspiring data scientist, I led this project to delve into the impact of logo changes on brand perception and consumer loyalty. The study explores whether a strategic reversion to the old logo could benefit Starbucks in reinforcing its brand connection with its audience.

## Objectives

-   To determine which Starbucks logo (old vs. new) is more popular among consumers.
-   To understand if exposure to the alternative logo version influences consumer preferences.

## Hypotheses

1.  **Popularity Hypothesis (H1):** The new Starbucks logo is significantly more popular than the old logo.
2.  **Influence Hypothesis (H2):** Participants who view the old logo are more likely to change their preference in favor of the new logo.

## Methodology

The project employs a randomized control trial design, using a coin flip method for unbiased group assignment. Participants were exposed to both logo versions, with their initial and subsequent preferences recorded. This approach allowed for a comprehensive analysis of consumer logo preference, controlling for potential biases.

## Key Findings

-   No significant difference in NPS or likeliness ratings between the old and new logos upon initial exposure.
-   Exposure to the old logo first led to a statistically significant preference for the new logo, suggesting a favorable shift.
-   Gender influenced the response to the new logo, with female participants showing a lower likelihood score for both logos.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights a subtle yet notable preference for the new Starbucks logo when consumers are exposed to both versions. This suggests that while nostalgia for the old logo exists, the streamlined, modern design of the new logo resonates more effectively with today’s consumer base.# Starbucks Logo Preference Analysis
